Just before I went on vacation the documentation PRs, i.e. [PR about adding a four bar linkage example][pull/23705] and [the PR explaining the joints framework using figures][pull/23730] were merged. Also [the PR][pull/23628], which improves the `Point.acc` method, was merged. However, after my holiday I heard the request of making these figures a bit smaller in filesize. So, this last week I converted them to SVGs in [this already merged PR][pull/23890]. After this I mainly did some reading up and investigating how we could introduce a `Mobilizer` joint as described in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-010-9717-3) by Seth, A., Sherman, M., Eastman, P., & Delp, S.

This lead to raising [this issue][issues/23913]. But the main thing I started working on is [this draft PR][pull/23920], which changes the definition of a `Joint` to be a bit more general. Where we were first using a `parent_axis` and `child_axis` to describe an intermediate frame and the joint axis. It is now changed to use a given intermediate frame for the parent as well as the child. And for the joint axis we use a separate argument `joint_axis`. I would love to write and explain a lot more about this PR, but if you are interested you'd better just visit [it][pull/23920].

Issues and PRs I'm working on:
- [this draft PR][pull/23920] which switches the `Joint` definition to use intermediate frames.
- Raised [issue][issues/23913] about a problem that defining a new joint in a certain way can lead to a deletion of a previous joint.
- Raised [issue][issues/23741] about the inconsistency in storing velocity and acceleration data in the `Point` class.
- [My comment][issues/21964#issuecomment-1173893507] on how we could make the `Body` class more analogous to a `ReferenceFrame`.

Some other opened issues an PRs, which I have open, but am not currently working on:
- [PR][pull/23580] I reviewed
- [Issue][issues/23706] about image readability in the new dark theme.
- [Issue][issues/23382] about using a recursive calculation of the velocity in the `Point.vel` method
- [Draft PR][pull/23359] which adds a check on the velocity and acceleration theories as mentioned in [the old PR][pull/12322]
  - Needs a decision as mentioned in [this comment][pull/23359#issuecomment-1155023883]
  - [An issue][issues/23269] I'm participating in, which is about making the `KanesMethod` compatible with the `Body` class.

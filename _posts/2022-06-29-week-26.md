Hi again, this is a quick post about my schedule for this GSoC. Made after meeting my mentors for a kickoff meeting, which was great by the way. As I already mentioned a bit in my first post is there a slight change. I will still be working on the documentation these first few weeks 'till July 14. August 8 I hope to start working on the kinematic loops for which I will have to research some other solutions for as well. At last I hope to implement add some more joints. The part which I will probably skip is adding option to define the orientation of a joint using quaternions. But overall I think it is going to be a nice fun challenge.

Issues and PRs I'll be working on:
- Opened a [draft PR][pull/23705] adding four bar linkage example which uses the joints framework.
- While working on the PR above I raised [an issue][issues/23706] on the visibility of images when using the new dark theme.
- This week and next week I expect to work on [the issue][issues/21705] about creating a figure to explain the joint parameters.
- Hope that [this PR][pull/23628], which would reduce `Point.acc` dependency on computed velocities, can be merged.

Some other opened issues an PRs, which I have open, but am not currently working on:
- [Issue][issues/23382] about using a recursive calculation of the velocity in the `Point.vel` method
- [Draft PR][pull/23359] which adds a check on the velocity and acceleration theories as mentioned in [the old PR][pull/12322]
  - Needs a decision as mentioned in [this comment][pull/23359#issuecomment-1155023883]

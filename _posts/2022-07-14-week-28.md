This is a short post, since I was busy this week with my last exam and preparing for my vacation next few weeks. This also means that I won't make posts for the next few weeks. As for now I am currently focused partially on making the `Body` class better integrated within the mechanics, while awaiting reviews on some documentation PRs.


Issues and PRs I'm working on:
- [PR][pull/23705], which adds a four bar linkage example using the joints framework.
- [This issue][issues/21705] about creating a figure to explain the joint parameters is being solved in [this PR][pull/23730]
- [The PR][pull/23628], which would reduce `Point.acc` dependency on computed velocities.
- Raised [issue][issues/23741] about the inconsistency in storing velocity and acceleration data in the `Point` class.
- [My comment][issues/21964#issuecomment-1173893507] on how we could make the `Body` class more analogous to a `ReferenceFrame`.

Some other opened issues an PRs, which I have open, but am not currently working on:
- [PR][pull/23580] I reviewed
- [Issue][issues/23706] about image readability in the new dark theme.
- [Issue][issues/23382] about using a recursive calculation of the velocity in the `Point.vel` method
- [Draft PR][pull/23359] which adds a check on the velocity and acceleration theories as mentioned in [the old PR][pull/12322]
  - Needs a decision as mentioned in [this comment][pull/23359#issuecomment-1155023883]
  - [An issue][issues/23269] I'm participating in, which is about making the `KanesMethod` compatible with the `Body` class.

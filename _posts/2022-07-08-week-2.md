This is finally the first week that I could work full time on GSoC. Started this week with reviewing [a PR][pull/23580] for the first time. Furthermore I mostly focused this week on documentation. You already saw the draft of [the four bar linkage example][pull/23705] last week. During which I ran into various other things. First of the amazing dark theme available in the [SymPy dev documentation] causes some images to be barely readable (raised [#23706][issues/23706]). Another thing I already new I wanted to do is that there should be a real guide on the Joints Framework. So I made a [draft PR][pull/23730] about implementing a real guide on the Joints Framework in the physics/mechanics module (checkout the image below for a quick preview). Yesterday, I presented this to my mentors and got positive feedback. We also had a discussion about consistency within the code which raised [this issue][issues/23741]. Also the planning is to have either next week or after my holiday a discussion about what we actually have within the Mechanics module and what we actually want.

Issues and PRs I'm working on:
- [The PR][pull/23580] I'm reviewing
- [PR][pull/23705], which adds a four bar linkage example using the joints framework.
- [This issue][issues/21705] about creating a figure to explain the joint parameters is being solved in [this PR][pull/23730]
- [The PR][pull/23628], which would reduce `Point.acc` dependency on computed velocities.
- Raised [issue][issues/23741] about the inconsistency in storing velocity and acceleration data in the `Point` class.

Some other opened issues an PRs, which I have open, but am not currently working on:
- [Issue][issues/23706] about image readability in the new dark theme.
- [Issue][issues/23382] about using a recursive calculation of the velocity in the `Point.vel` method
- [Draft PR][pull/23359] which adds a check on the velocity and acceleration theories as mentioned in [the old PR][pull/12322]
  - Needs a decision as mentioned in [this comment][pull/23359#issuecomment-1155023883]

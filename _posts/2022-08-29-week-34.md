This week I finally set [this PR][pull/23920] on intermediate frames as ready to review. Besides that I have also created [a PR][pull/23981], which adds the optional frame argument to `RigidBody.parallel_axis` and also implements the `parallel_axis` method for the `Body` class. As well as [a PR][pull/23982] which partially fixes [the issue][issues/23269] of `KanesMethod` not being compatible with `Body` objects, which represents a `Particle`. This is done by changing the inertia of a `Body` representing a `Particle` to zero. Besides that [this PR][pull/23982] also adds a central inertia setter to `RigidBody`. As a last thing I have been working on is the implementation of new joint types, mainly the `SphericalJoint`. However I have not yet published a PR for this, since my implementation is currently dependent on [the PR][pull/23890] on intermediate frames.

Issues and PRs I'm working on:
- [This PR][pull/23920] which switches the `Joint` definition to use intermediate frames.
- [This PR][pull/23981] which implements the `parallel_axis` method for the `Body` class.
- [This PR][pull/23982] which changes the inertia of a `Body` representing a `Particle` to zero.
- Raised [issue][issues/23933] about the dependency between `test_pinjoin_arbitrary_axis` and `test_functions.py`.
- Raised [issue][issues/23913] about a problem that defining a new joint in a certain way can lead to a deletion of a previous joint.
- Raised [issue][issues/23741] about the inconsistency in storing velocity and acceleration data in the `Point` class.
- [My comment][issues/21964#issuecomment-1173893507] on how we could make the `Body` class more analogous to a `ReferenceFrame`.

Some other opened issues an PRs, which I have open, but am not currently working on:
- [PR][pull/23580] I reviewed (awaiting changes)
- [Issue][issues/23706] about image readability in the new dark theme.
- [Issue][issues/23382] about using a recursive calculation of the velocity in the `Point.vel` method
- [Draft PR][pull/23359] which adds a check on the velocity and acceleration theories as mentioned in [the old PR][pull/12322]
  - Needs a decision as mentioned in [this comment][pull/23359#issuecomment-1155023883]
  - [An issue][issues/23269] I'm participating in, which is about making the `KanesMethod` compatible with the `Body` class.

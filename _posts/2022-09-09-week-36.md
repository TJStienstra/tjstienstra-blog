Decided to make my posts on Friday, so it is more of a reflection of past week (in this case a little more). Besides that I'm also gonna try to keep using the format of my midterm overview. So what has happened:
- <span style="color:green">Merged PR</span> [#23981] adding an optional frame argument to `RigidBody.parallel_axis` and implementing `Body.parallel_axis`.
- <span style="color:green">Merged PR</span> [#23982] changing `Body` to always have an inertia, also when representing a `Particle`. This will partially solve <span style="color:red">issue</span> [#23269].
- <span style="color:green">Merged PR</span> [#23920] changing the definition of a `Joint` to use intermediate frames. Something that was specifically added last week was the support for supplying an axis with which the interframe should align its X axis. Something which surprisingly gives the exact same results as `parent_axis` and `child_axis` did (means that those rotations were actually chosen more logical than I thought).
- <span style="color:green">Closed issue</span> [#23913] on the problem that the use of temporary relationships between `ReferenceFrame`s in the `Joint` class can lead to deleting correct relations. Was also fixed in [#23920].
- <span style="color:red">Raised issue</span> [#1929] in the `symengine` on the problem of stackability of null Matrices.
- <span style="color:green">Raised and closed issue</span> [#24005] on the problem that a CI slow test 2 failed due to a timeout. However due to irreproducibility this issue was also closed.
- <span style="color:blue">Opened PR</span> [#24028] implementing a generic coordinate generation helper, which is ready for merging.
- <span style="color:blue">Opened draft PR</span> [#24037] implementing the `CylindricalJoint`, which will be ready for review as soon as [#24028] is merged.

As you can see from the list above, quite a few things have happened and I'm happy with the progress. A lot of this progress is also due to the help in reviewing and conceptual problem solving I got from Sam Brockie, who is now also able to work full time on SymPy. Next week I also hope to publish the PRs of the `PlanarJoint` and `SphericalJoint`. And probably also finish of that state saving issue [#23741] by just going for the easy solution, namely leaving almost everything as is and just removing the to aggressive relation deletion of `ReferenceFrame._dcm` ([#23913]).
